        <p>Give this classic dish a makeover with a touch of spice. We've kept it mild, but you can boost the heat with added curry powder or fresh chilli, if you like</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
<p class="ingredients">
    2 tbsp rapeseed oil, plus extra for drizzling<br>
2 onions, chopped<br>
500g lamb mince<br>
thumb-sized piece ginger<br>
3 garlic cloves, crushed<br>
½ tsp ground cinnamon<br>
1 tsp turmeric<br>
2 tbsp mild or medium curry powder<br>
1 tbsp tomato purée<br>
1 lamb stock cube or beef stock cube<br>
pinch sugar<br>
4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks<br>
4 large potatoes<br>
50g mature cheddar, grated<br>
</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div class="method">
       <p><u>Method:</u></p>
        <p class="method"><u>STEP 1</u><br><br>
            Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onions until soft and starting to brown, about 8-10 mins. Push to one side of the pan and add the lamb. Leave the meat alone until the underside is browning, then break it down with the back of a spoon. Leave to brown for a few mins more, then stir in the ginger, garlic, spices and tomato purée. Stir for a few mins until the mixture is sticky and aromatic. Add 600ml water, the stock cube and the sugar.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 2</u><br><br>
            Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook for 45 mins, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The sauce should be thick but if it reduces too quickly, add a splash of water or cover with a lid.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 3</u><br><br>
            Put the sweet potatoes and potatoes in a pan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, cover with a lid and simmer for 15 mins until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry for 10 mins.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 4</u><br><br>
            Mash the potatoes with the cheese and some seasoning. Tip the mince into a baking dish about 20 x 35cm and 10cm deep. Stir in the peas. Cover with the mash, making dips and peaks with the back of your spoon, or pipe the mash on for a neater finish. Crush the poppadums in your hands and scatter over the mash, then drizzle over a little oil. You can now chill for up to two days or freeze for two months. If cooking straightaway, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 5</u><br><br>
            Bake for 45 mins until golden and bubbling around the edges. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then serve with the green chilli scattered over, if you like.
