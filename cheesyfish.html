        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
<p class="ingredients">
    200g Maris Piper potatoes<br>
1 tbsp butter<br>
1 tbsp flour<br>
200ml whole milk<br>
½ tsp Dijon mustard<br>
100g cheddar, gruyère or emmental, grated<br>
200g fish pie mix<br>
50g frozen peas<br>
50g shredded kale<br>
1 spring onion, finely sliced<br>
1 tbsp parmesan, finely grated<br>
green salad, to serve (optional)<br>

       <p><u>Method:</u></p>
        <p class="method"><u>STEP 1</u><br><br>
            Tip the potatoes into a pan, cover with hot water from the kettle and add a pinch of salt. Simmer for 15-20 mins until tender, then drain and leave to steam-dry.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 2</u><br><br>
            Meanwhile, warm the butter in a heavy-based pan over a low heat. Add the flour and stir until you have a paste. Gradually whisk in 200ml milk until you have a thick white sauce. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring. Season, then stir in the mustard and half the cheese, and continue to stir until the cheese has melted. Fold in the fish, peas and kale, and cook for 8 mins more, or until the kale wilts, the fish is just cooked and the prawns are starting to turn pink.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 3</u><br><br>
            Heat the grill to medium-high. Mash the potatoes with the spring onion and 1 tbsp milk. Fold in the remaining cheese and season well.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 4</u><br><br>
            Tip the filling into a heatproof dish and spoon the cheesy mash on top, swirling it with a fork until the filling is completely covered. Sprinkle over the parmesan and grill for 10-15 mins until the pie is golden and bubbling. Serve with a green salad, if you like. Uncooked pie, well covered in the dish, will keep in the freezer for up to three months.
