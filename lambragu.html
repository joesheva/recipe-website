        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
<p class="ingredients">
    1½ tbsp olive oil/
500g lamb shoulder/
2 celery sticks, finely chopped/
2 carrots, finely chopped/
1 large onion, finely chopped/
1 tbsp Italian seasoning/
3 garlic cloves/

2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes/
240ml red or white wine/

    <div class="method">
       <p><u>Method:</u></p>
        <p class="method"><u>STEP 1</u><br><br>
            In a large, lidded saucepan, heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil over a medium heat and brown the lamb all over. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the remaining oil to the pan, reduce the heat to low and tip in the celery, carrot, onion and Italian seasoning. Mix well, then put the lid on and cook for 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally until the veg is soft but not golden. Add the garlic and bay leaves, stir, then cook for 1 min. Mix in the tomato purée and the chopped tomatoes (swill out the cans with a little water and add that as well), then the wine, browned lamb and lamb stock. Season well with salt and black pepper. Put the lid back on, bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hr. Remove the lid and simmer gently for the final hour. At this point, you can leave to cool before chilling. Will keep chilled for three days or frozen for up to three months. Defrost fully in the fridge overnight and heat through in a pan until piping hot before serving.
            <br><br>
            <u>STEP 2</u><br><br>
            To make the polenta, pour the milk into a saucepan with 300ml water and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Tip in the polenta or cornmeal with 1 tsp each salt and ground black pepper. Cook for 3-4 mins, whisking or stirring constantly until the polenta has thickened. Stir in the parmesan and butter, and mix again until the butter has melted and the polenta is smooth. Spoon onto plates or bowls, then top with the lamb ragu. Grate over extra parmesan, if you like.
